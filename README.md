# Exploring Data Science
***
This Github Repository contains a collection of mini projects I have conducted to gain experience, knowledge and understanding about various topics relating to Data Science during the course of my University such as:
* Unsupervised Learning: K Means Clustering etc.
* Supervised Learning: Regression, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes etc.
* Reinforcement Learning: Markov Decision Processes, Q Learning etc.
***
*More topics will be added to this repository as I delve into other related topics*
